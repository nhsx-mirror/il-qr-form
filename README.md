# Innovation Lab QR Code Prototyping Tool

## Introduction

As part of the Innovation Lab's Show My Patient ID project (formerly Admit Me, which wasn't descriptive enough), we need to be able to quickly and easily try out different QR code content and data formats.  This project lets us do that, generating QR code graphics from provided text and format choices while being simple enough to hack together new formats as necessary.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
